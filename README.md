# HackRF-Test-Network

TLDR: this repository is devoted to the collection, organisation and sharing of measurements and test results about the HackRF and Portapacks boards.


# Why?

The HackRF and Portapack projects are opensource and pushed forward by vouluntary work. These vouluntiers work for free and not always have access to all of the following:
- various HackRF boards (original, chienese clones, Portapack H1, Portapack H2,...) to experiment on,
- various computers (Macintosh, PC, Raspberry, etc) and radio gear (Ham-it-up, antennas, amplifiers, filters, etc)  
- test equipment (multimeters, oscilloscopes, frequency counters, spectrum analyzers, etc)
- time to test stuff.

This repository serves the purpose of connecting people having some (but not all) of the above with the goal of helping each other.
